					Bloodline was started in 2007 sighting the lack of awareness among people in this part of the country regarding the importance
					of blood donation. It was a major challenge since the situation was further hampered by the low literacy rate and the
					backward economy of this region. Even before man understood the true nature of blood and its functions, the importance
					of blood for the human body remained disputed. One simple reason for this was the basic understanding that excessive
					loss of blood can cause death. But unlike old times when a serious injury, AIDS or a pregnancy complication would mean
					certain death, the improvement in blood preservation technology has made it possible to transfuse blood from a healthy
					person to one in need even if a donor with the same blood group isn’t readily available. However, even today, the demand
					exceeds the available preserved blood mostly due to lack of voluntary donations owing to little awareness and misconceptions
					about safe blood donations. One of the most ambitious and unique projects by a student run NGO, “Bloodline” is a voluntary
					blood donation society under Fast Forward India. Bloodline caters to the needs of blood transfusion of people residing
					in Dhanbad and adjacent areas. Our aim is to spread awareness about voluntary blood donations and to encourage people
					towards doing it regularly. In India, the annual collection of blood is only 5.5-6 million units against the requirement
					of about 8.5 million units. It is sad that if only 3% of India's eligible population regularly donates their blood,
					there will be no shortage of blood and its components in blood banks. This would mean that a significant number of deaths
					could be avoided if people donate blood regularly and voluntarily so that safe blood is always available. But the main
					reason behind this sadistic situation is the unawareness, myths and misconceptions that are still obsessing the minds
					of Indian people even in the 21st Century.

				<p>
					No one shall die in Dhanbad for the want of Blood. This has been our motto since the inception of Bloodline. To achieve this,
					our current objective is to register at least 1,000 new donors in a year by means of donor motivation, promotion of
					the concept of Voluntary Blood Donation and by repeating Regular Voluntary Blood Donation campaigns.

			<div class="panel">
				<p>At the start of each academic session, Bloodline conducts a presentation and a survey among all the students, faculty
					members, security guards and other individuals of ISM and collects the contacts, blood group and other relevant details
					of all those who are interested to donate blood. When any blood request comes, the database is referred to and an individual
					with required blood group is contacted for blood donation. One of the volunteers accompanies the donor and ensures a
					safe donation process.</p><br>
				<h2>BLOOD CAMPS</h2>
				<p>Blood camps are organized once every three months. A number of students from ISM Dhanbad voluntarily donate blood in
					these camps.</p><br>
				<h2>SCHOOL VISITS</h2>
				<p>Team Bloodline regularly visits the schools of Dhanbad and its nearby villages giving important information about blood
					donations. Although this isn’t a very attractive prospect for the short term, we expect it to reap dividends in the
					longer run when these kids grow up to be civilized citizens of the country. Inculcating these qualities in the children
					at an early stage should prove important in realizing our long term vision.</p><br>
				<h2>NUKKAD NATIKA</h2>
				<p> For spreading awareness among the general public and for motivating them for blood donation, Nukkad Natikas (street plays)
					are organized. The Nukkad Natak team comprising of boys and girls perform Nukkad Nataks during the camps. Special Nukkad
					Nataks are performed in the slums, at Dhanbad railway station and other important places.</p>
