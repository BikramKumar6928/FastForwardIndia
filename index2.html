							the concept of Voluntary Blood Donation and by repeating Regular Voluntary Blood Donation campaigns.

							This branch of FFI was started with a vision that DISHA will eradicate, the chimera of misinformation and ignorance, so that
							no student pays the cost because of such things. As in various cases, parents are not well-informed over the current
							career options and are often misguided. Also, there are cases where due to financial constraints, higher studies arenâ€™t
							a priority. DISHA provides the students with a medium through which they can explore their options when they complete
							their 10+2.
